          Most AI conversations aimed at investors are either thinly disguised
          vendor pitches or abstract futurism. Useful work lives in the space
          between: understanding what models can do today, what is plausible in
          the next few years, and how that maps to positions, risk, and
          portfolio company strategy.

          I have sat on your side of the table. I know what it feels like when
          there are too many names, not enough time, and an IC that needs crisp
          answers by Friday. My consulting work is built around that reality.

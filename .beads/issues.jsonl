{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","title":"EPIC: Create /tldr Page - Comprehensive Flywheel Tools Showcase","description":"# EPIC: /tldr Page - Comprehensive Flywheel Tools Showcase\n\n## Background \u0026 Vision\nThis epic covers the creation of a new `/tldr` page on the personal site that serves as a comprehensive, \nvisually stunning showcase of all the Agentic Coding Flywheel tools. The page should be THE definitive \nquick-reference for understanding what each tool does, why it's valuable, and how they work together.\n\n## Why This Matters\nThe flywheel tools represent a cohesive ecosystem for multi-agent coding workflows. Currently, \nunderstanding how they fit together requires visiting multiple repos. This page will:\n1. Provide instant understanding of each tool's purpose\n2. Highlight the synergistic connections between tools\n3. Serve as an onboarding resource for new users\n4. Demonstrate the ecosystem's completeness and sophistication\n\n## Core Tools to Feature\n\n### PRIMARY FLYWHEEL TOOLS (7 tools):\n1. **NTM (Named Tmux Manager)** - Multi-agent tmux orchestration\n2. **SLB (Simultaneous Launch Button)** - Two-person rule for dangerous commands\n3. **MCP Agent Mail** - Inter-agent messaging and coordination\n4. **BV (Beads Viewer)** - Graph analytics for Steve Yegge's Beads system\n5. **UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)** - Multi-language static analysis\n6. **CM (CASS Memory System)** - Persistent memory across sessions\n7. **CASS (Coding Agent Session Search)** - Full-text search across sessions\n\n### SUPPORTING TOOLS (5+ tools):\n8. **DCG (Destructive Command Guard)** - Safety hook for blocking dangerous commands\n9. **GIIL** - Git-backed interactive issue list\n10. **XF** - Fast cross-file search and replace\n11. **Source to Prompt TUI** - Convert codebases to LLM prompts\n12. **Repo Updater** - Sync multiple GitHub repos\n13. **Agentic Coding Flywheel Setup** - One-command environment setup\n\n## Key Synergies to Highlight\n- Beads (Steve Yegge's) → BV provides visualization/analytics\n- Agent Mail ↔ Beads: Task IDs link conversations to issues\n- NTM → Agent Mail: Spawned agents communicate via mail\n- SLB → Agent Mail: Approval requests delivered to inboxes\n- UBS → BV: Scanner results create blocking issues\n- CASS → CM: Semantic search over stored memories\n- DCG → NTM/Claude Code: Safety layer for all agent commands\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- **Extremely polished** - This is a showcase page\n- **Microinteractions** - Hover states, smooth transitions\n- **Visual hierarchy** - Primary tools prominent, supporting tools organized\n- **Synergy visualization** - Show connections between tools\n- **Responsive** - Works beautifully on all screen sizes\n- **Accessible** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support\n\n## Page Structure (per tool)\nEach tool card should have these sections:\n1. **What it does** - Clear, concise explanation (2-3 sentences)\n2. **Why it's useful** - The value proposition (2-3 sentences)\n3. **Implementation** - Language, key tech highlights (very concise)\n4. **Synergies** - Which tools it connects to and how (concise)\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Create new route: app/tldr/page.tsx and layout.tsx\n2. Build reusable TldrToolCard component\n3. Build TldrSynergyDiagram component\n4. Add animations via Framer Motion\n5. Use existing design system (slate colors, gradients, etc.)\n\n## Source Code Research Required\nEach tool requires a subagent to review its source code and extract:\n- Accurate description of functionality\n- Key implementation details (language, patterns, performance)\n- Actual synergies based on code (imports, integrations)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All 12+ tools documented with accurate, compelling copy\n- Visual design matches or exceeds existing site quality\n- Synergies clearly communicated\n- Page loads fast (lazy loading where needed)\n- Mobile-responsive and accessible","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:13:13.459530629-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T14:49:15.278387502-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T14:49:15.278387502-05:00","close_reason":"EPIC complete: /tldr page implemented with all 13 flywheel tools, comprehensive UI, E2E tests, and navigation integration","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-5w8","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.52995532-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-hio","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.562162254-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-9y7","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.587112169-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-ouf","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.609989991-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-2bq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.635146455-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-86p","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:29:16.661596065-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-8mq","title":"Build multi-repo stargazer analysis script","description":"# Task: Build Multi-Repo Stargazer Analysis Script\n\n## Context\n\nPort and enhance the logic from most-influential-github-repo-stars to analyze ALL of Jeffrey's repos (or selected flywheel repos) and output aggregated intelligence. This script runs locally or via GitHub Action to generate pre-computed JSON data.\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\nLocation: `/tmp/most-influential-github-repo-stars/app/api/github-influencers/route.js`\n\nKey functions to port:\n- `processUser()` - Fetch user details, calculate score\n- `calculateScore()` - The influence scoring algorithm\n- `fetchStargazers()` - Paginated stargazer fetching\n- Caching logic (SQLite-based in original)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Sample Data File (FIRST MILESTONE)\n\n**Create this FIRST to unblock component development (l47) in parallel:**\n\nFile: `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json`\n\nContents: Realistic mock data with:\n- 5-10 fake notable stargazers\n- Plausible scores and companies\n- Proper structure matching TypeScript interfaces\n\nThis allows the component task to proceed in parallel!\n\n### 2. Analysis Script\n\nFile: `scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts` (or .js)\n\nFeatures:\n- Process multiple repos (configurable list)\n- Aggregate unique stargazers across repos\n- Track which repos each user starred\n- Calculate influence scores\n- Aggregate company statistics\n- Output to JSON file\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\nDefine which repos to analyze:\n```typescript\nconst REPOS_TO_ANALYZE = [\n  'Dicklesworthstone/mcp-agent-mail',\n  'Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer',\n  'Dicklesworthstone/cass-memory-system',\n  // ... flywheel repos\n];\n```\n\nOr: analyze ALL public repos for the user.\n\n### 4. Output Format\n\nFile: `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json`\n\nStructure (per design task specifications):\n```json\n{\n  \"totalUniqueStargazers\": 1234,\n  \"combinedReach\": 2500000,\n  \"combinedStars\": 150000,\n  \"topCompanies\": [...],\n  \"topStargazers\": [...],\n  \"byRepo\": {...},\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-12-17T...\"\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Rate Limit Handling\n\nGitHub API limits:\n- 5000 requests/hour with auth\n- Each user requires ~3 requests (profile, repos, events)\n\nStrategies:\n- Process in batches with delays\n- Use conditional requests (If-Modified-Since)\n- Cache user data between runs\n- Skip users below score threshold quickly\n\n### 6. Caching Layer\n\nRecommendation: JSON cache file for simplicity (`.stargazer-cache.json`), can upgrade to SQLite if needed.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Create sample data file first** (enables parallel work)\n2. Set up script scaffolding with TypeScript\n3. Port scoring algorithm\n4. Add multi-repo fetching\n5. Implement deduplication (users who starred multiple repos)\n6. Add company extraction and normalization\n7. Generate output JSON\n8. Add CLI arguments for flexibility\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Running Locally\n```bash\n# With bun\nGITHUB_TOKEN=xxx bun run scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts\n\n# Output\nWriting results to lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json\nAnalyzed 30 repos, found 5,432 unique stargazers\nTop stargazer: @influential_dev (score: 125,000)\n```\n\n### Company Normalization\n\nKeep it simple:\n- Strip \"@\" prefix\n- Trim whitespace\n- That's it. Don't over-engineer.\n\n### Score Thresholds\n\n- Only include users with score \u003e 500 in output\n- Keeps JSON size manageable (~50KB target)\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- Individual user fetch failures: log and skip\n- Rate limit: exponential backoff\n- Network errors: retry with delay\n- Missing repos: warn and continue\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Design task (for output format)\n- Blocks: GitHub Action task, Integration tasks\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] **Sample data file created** (milestone 1, unblocks l47)\n- [ ] Script runs successfully on all flywheel repos\n- [ ] Output matches TypeScript interfaces from design task\n- [ ] Rate limiting handled gracefully\n- [ ] Top 50+ notable stargazers identified\n- [ ] Per-repo breakdown included\n- [ ] Script completes in \u003c10 minutes for full analysis\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- Repo with 0 stargazers\n- Deleted GitHub accounts\n- Private profiles (limited data)\n- Very large repos (10K+ stars) - pagination\n- Users with no public repos (can't calculate their stars)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:52:44.484113852-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T00:47:20.758156328-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T00:47:20.758156328-05:00","close_reason":"Created scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts that analyzes stargazers across 7 repos and generates real data.

Since we're analyzing Jeffrey's own public repos, this should work without creating a separate PAT.\n\nTry the default token first:\n```yaml\nenv:\n  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nOnly create a PAT if you hit permission issues (unlikely for public repo analysis).\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow\n\nFile: `.github/workflows/update-stargazers.yml`\n\n```yaml\nname: Update Stargazer Intelligence\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Weekly on Sunday at 3 AM UTC\n    - cron: '0 3 * * 0'\n  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write  # Needed for committing changes\n\njobs:\n  analyze:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1\n        \n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: bun install\n        \n      - name: Run stargazer analysis\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Default token should work\\!\n        run: bun run scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts\n        \n      - name: Commit and push if changed\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json\n          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m \"chore: update stargazer intelligence data\"\n          git push\n```\n\n### 2. If Default Token Doesn't Work (Fallback)\n\nOnly if you hit issues:\n1. Create PAT at github.com/settings/tokens with `public_repo` scope\n2. Add as repo secret: `STARGAZER_ANALYSIS_TOKEN`\n3. Update workflow to use it\n\n## Schedule Considerations\n\n**Weekly (recommended)**\n- Star data changes slowly\n- Reduces API usage\n- Sufficient for credibility display\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Manually trigger workflow via GitHub UI (`workflow_dispatch`)\n2. Verify script runs successfully\n3. Check commit appears in repo\n4. Verify JSON file is valid\n5. Trigger build to confirm data is used\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Script task (must exist and work)\n- No downstream blockers\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Workflow file created and valid\n- [ ] Manual trigger works\n- [ ] Scheduled run executes successfully\n- [ ] Changes committed automatically\n- [ ] Default GITHUB_TOKEN confirmed working (or PAT set up if needed)\n\n## Future Enhancements (out of scope)\n\n- Conditional runs (skip if no new stars)\n- PR-based updates instead of direct commits\n- Failure notifications beyond GitHub defaults","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:53:09.145805616-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T01:00:25.835659532-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T01:00:25.835659532-05:00","close_reason":"Closed","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-azd","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-8mq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:54:43.853520879-05:00","created_by":"daemon","metadata":"{}"}]}

Unit Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library)\nTest individual components in isolation:\n- TldrToolCard: rendering, props, expand/collapse, accessibility\n- TldrToolGrid: layout, filtering, sorting, empty states\n- TldrSynergyDiagram: node rendering, connection highlighting, interactions\n- TldrHero: rendering, animations (mocked), CTA functionality\n- tldr-data.ts: helper functions, data integrity\n\n### 2. Integration Tests\nTest components working together:\n- Grid with Cards: data flow, selection, filtering\n- Page with all components: complete render, routing\n\n### 3. E2E Tests (Playwright)\nTest real user journeys:\n- Page loads and renders all tools\n- Tool card expand/collapse works\n- Synergy diagram interactions\n- Navigation to/from page\n- Keyboard navigation through entire page\n- Mobile interactions (touch, swipe)\n\n### 4. Visual Regression Tests\nSnapshot testing to catch unintended visual changes:\n- Full page screenshots at multiple breakpoints\n- Component snapshots\n- Animation state captures\n\n### 5. Accessibility Tests\nAutomated accessibility validation:\n- axe-core integration in tests\n- Keyboard navigation verification\n- Focus management testing\n\n## Logging Requirements\nAll tests must include detailed logging:\n- Test setup/teardown actions logged\n- Assertions with descriptive messages\n- Timing information for performance-sensitive tests\n- Screenshots on failure (E2E)\n- DOM snapshots on failure (unit tests)\n\n## Test File Structure\n```\ncomponents/tldr/__tests__/\n├── tool-card.test.tsx\n├── tool-grid.test.tsx\n├── synergy-diagram.test.tsx\n├── hero.test.tsx\n└── integration.test.tsx\n\nlib/__tests__/\n└── tldr-data.test.ts\n\ne2e/\n└── tldr.spec.ts  (Playwright)\n\ntest-utils/\n└── tldr-test-helpers.ts\n```\n\n## Coverage Targets\n- Unit tests: 90%+ line coverage for tldr components\n- E2E tests: All critical user paths covered\n- Accessibility: Zero axe violations\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: All components built (to test)\n- Parallel with: Manual testing tasks","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:24:18.058996982-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T14:47:34.569127564-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-12T14:47:34.569127564-05:00","close_reason":"Testing infrastructure complete with Playwright config and comprehensive E2E tests","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-9np","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.370920512-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-p34","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.395119333-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-750","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.419628087-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-kze","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.444084653-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-d4f","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.468086792-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dbo","depends_on_id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-6f3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-12T12:30:34.491903363-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dxw","title":"Notable Stargazers Intelligence","description":"# Epic: Notable Stargazers Intelligence\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nTransform GitHub presence from vanity metrics (\"10K+ stars\") to meaningful social proof (\"starred by engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta with 2M+ combined reach\"). This feature surfaces WHO starred Jeffrey's repos, not just how many—a powerful credibility signal that most developer portfolios lack.\n\n## Strategic Context\n\n### The Problem with Raw Star Counts\n- Stars are easily inflated (bots, inactive accounts, drive-by clicks)\n- A star from a developer with 100K followers ≠ a star from an empty account\n- Visitors can't assess the QUALITY of engagement from a number alone\n\n### The Solution: Stargazer Intelligence\nLeverage the scoring algorithm from Jeffrey's existing tool (most-influential-github-repo-stars) to:\n1. Analyze all stargazers across flywheel repos\n2. Calculate influence scores based on followers, stars, activity\n3. Surface the most notable individuals and their companies\n4. Display this intelligence throughout the site\n\n### Why This Matters for jeffreyemanuel.com\n- **Credibility**: \"Used by engineers at top AI companies\" \u003e \"10K stars\"\n- **Enterprise signal**: Company affiliations suggest production use\n- **Network proof**: Shows flywheel tools penetrated influential circles\n- **Differentiation**: Sophisticated social proof most portfolios lack\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Data Pipeline (Pre-computed, not real-time)\n```\nGitHub API → Analysis Script → JSON file → Build time → Static props\n     ↑                              ↓\n  Weekly via                   Committed to repo\n  GitHub Action                (version controlled)\n```\n\nWhy pre-compute:\n- GitHub API rate limits (5000/hr) make real-time infeasible\n- Star data changes slowly—weekly updates suffice\n- Zero runtime latency\n- Automated via GitHub Action\n\n### Scoring Algorithm (from most-influential-github-repo-stars)\n```javascript\nscore = totalStars * 2.5 + followers * 2.0 + contributions * 0.1 + recentActivity * 0.1\n```\n\nThis weights:\n- Total stars across their repos (proxy for code quality/impact)\n- Follower count (proxy for influence/reach)\n- Contributions (proxy for activity level)\n- Recent activity (proxy for current engagement)\n\n### Data Model\n```typescript\ninterface StargazerIntelligence {\n  totalUniqueStargazers: number;\n  combinedReach: number;           // Sum of followers\n  combinedStars: number;           // Sum of their total stars\n  topCompanies: { name: string; count: number }[];\n  topStargazers: NotableStargazer[];\n  byRepo: Record\u003cstring, RepoStargazerStats\u003e;\n  lastUpdated: string;\n}\n\ninterface NotableStargazer {\n  login: string;\n  name: string;\n  avatarUrl: string;\n  company?: string;\n  followers: number;\n  totalStars: number;\n  score: number;\n  starredRepos: string[];  // Which of Jeffrey's repos they starred\n}\n```\n\n## Display Contexts\n\n| Location | Display | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| Homepage | Aggregate stats + top 5 avatars | Immediate credibility |\n| Project pages | Top 3-5 per-repo stargazers | Per-project proof |\n| (Future) /community | Full ranked list | Deep dive |\n\n## UX Principles\n\nFollowing site design philosophy:\n- **Understated confidence**: Let facts speak, no boasting\n- **Depth on demand**: Summary visible, details for curious\n- **Visual elegance**: Avatar strips, clean typography\n- **Mobile-first**: Responsive layouts\n\n## Relationship to Other Work\n\n**Complements GitHub Heartbeat (2ce)**:\n- Heartbeat = \"The flywheel is actively spinning\" (velocity/activity)\n- Notable Stargazers = \"Look who's using it\" (credibility/quality)\n- Both enhance GitHub presence, different angles\n\n**Independent of Content Enhancement (wh8)**:\n- This has substantial technical component (data pipeline)\n- Warrants own epic for tracking\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Homepage displays aggregate stargazer intelligence\n2. Project pages show per-repo notable stargazers\n3. Data updates automatically weekly via GitHub Action\n4. Zero runtime API calls (all pre-computed)\n5. Mobile-responsive display\n6. Accessible (proper alt text, ARIA labels)\n\n## Out of Scope (for now)\n\n- Real-time updates\n- Full /community page (can add later)\n- Integration with endorsements section\n- Stargazer notifications/alerts\n\n## Child Tasks\n\n1. Design: Data model, scoring, UX specifications\n2. Script: Multi-repo stargazer analysis\n3. Action: GitHub Action for automation\n4. Component: NotableStargazers display widget\n5. Homepage: Integration\n6.

This provides context-specific social proof—visitors can see who specifically endorsed THIS project.\n\n## Why P3?\n\n- Homepage integration (P2) provides the primary value\n- Project pages are secondary touchpoint\n- Can ship homepage first, add this later\n- Still important for complete feature\n\n## Current Project Page Structure\n\nFrom `/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`:\n1. Hero with project title/description\n2. Tech stack badges\n3. Links (GitHub, demo, etc.)\n4. Features list\n5. Installation/usage\n6. Related projects\n\n## Placement\n\n**Recommended: After tech stack, before features**\n\nRationale:\n- Early enough to establish credibility\n- After basic info (what it is)\n- Before detailed features (builds interest)\n\n**Alternative: Sidebar on desktop**\n- Less prominent but always visible\n- More complex responsive handling\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Component Usage\n\n```tsx\n{/* Notable Stargazers for this repo */}\n{stargazerData.byRepo[project.slug] \u0026\u0026 (\n  \u003cNotableStargazers\n    variant=\"project\"\n    repoSlug={project.slug}\n    maxItems={5}\n    showStats={false}\n  /\u003e\n)}\n```\n\n### Data Mapping\n\nNeed to map project slugs to repo names:\n```typescript\n// In lib/content.ts or separate mapping\nconst SLUG_TO_REPO: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e = {\n  'mcp-agent-mail': 'Dicklesworthstone/mcp-agent-mail',\n  'beads-viewer': 'Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer',\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nOr: Use GitHub URL from project data to extract repo name.\n\n### Display Design\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Notable developers using this                  │\n│                                                 │\n│  [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤]                      │\n│  Jane Doe, Google · John Smith, Anthropic       │\n│  + 47 more developers                           │\n│                                                 │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\nCompact, doesn't dominate the page.\n\n### Fallback Handling\n\nNot all repos will have notable stargazers:\n- New repos with few stars\n- Repos not analyzed\n- Repos with no high-score users\n\nFallback options:\n1. Hide section entirely (cleanest)\n2. Show generic message: \"Star this project to join the community\"\n3. Show total star count instead\n\n**Recommendation**: Hide if no notable stargazers.

{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-l47","title":"Create NotableStargazers display component","description":"# Task: Create NotableStargazers Display Component\n\n## Context\n\nBuild a reusable React component that displays stargazer intelligence in various contexts (homepage, project pages). This component is the visual face of the Notable Stargazers feature.\n\n## Parallel Development Note\n\n**This task can start as soon as the sample data file exists\\!**\n\nThe script task (8mq) will create `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json` as its first milestone. Once that exists, you can develop this component in parallel while the full analysis script is being built.\n\nDuring development:\n```tsx\nimport stargazerData from '@/lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json';\n// Later: switch to stargazer-intelligence.json when real data exists\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\nFollowing site patterns from existing components:\n- Use Framer Motion for animations with `useReducedMotion`\n- Tailwind CSS for styling (slate/violet color palette)\n- Glass card aesthetic where appropriate\n- Mobile-first responsive design\n- Proper accessibility (ARIA, alt text)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Core Component\n\nFile: `components/notable-stargazers.tsx`\n\n```tsx\ninterface NotableStargazersProps {\n  /** Display mode */\n  variant: 'homepage' | 'project' | 'compact';\n  \n  /** For 'project' variant - which repo to show */\n  repoSlug?: string;\n  \n  /** Maximum stargazers to display */\n  maxItems?: number;\n  \n  /** Show aggregate stats */\n  showStats?: boolean;\n  \n  /** Additional CSS classes */\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function NotableStargazers({ ... }: NotableStargazersProps) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Display Variants\n\n**Homepage Variant (`variant=\"homepage\"`)**\n- Aggregate stats: \"Starred by X developers with Y combined reach\"\n- Avatar strip of top 5-8 stargazers\n- Company mentions: \"Including engineers from Google, Anthropic, Meta\"\n\n**Project Variant (`variant=\"project\"`)**  \n- Per-repo stats: \"X notable developers starred this\"\n- Avatar strip of top 3-5 for that repo\n\n**Compact Variant (`variant=\"compact\"`)**\n- Minimal: Just avatar strip\n- For tight spaces or secondary placements\n\n### 3. Sub-Components\n\n**StargazerAvatar** (inline or separate file)\n- Circular avatar with hover tooltip\n- Links to GitHub profile\n- Fallback for missing images\n\n### 4. Data Loading\n\nImport pre-computed JSON data:\n```tsx\nimport stargazerData from '@/lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json';\n```\n\nHandle missing/stale data gracefully (hide component if no data).\n\n### 5. Animations\n\nUsing Framer Motion:\n- Staggered avatar appearance\n- Subtle hover scale on avatars\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n### 6. Visual Design\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Starred by 500+ developers with 2.1M combined reach        │\n│  Including engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta       │\n│                                                             │\n│  [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤]  + 492 more       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Color Palette\n- Background: slate-900/50 with glass effect\n- Accent: violet-500 for highlights  \n- Avatar borders: subtle ring on hover\n\n### Mobile Behavior\n- Avatar strip scrolls horizontally or wraps\n- Tap to show tooltip (no hover on mobile)\n\n### Error States\n- No data: Hide component entirely\n- Missing avatars: Fallback to initials\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Design task (w3q) for TypeScript interfaces\n- **Can start with sample data** from 8mq milestone 1\n- Blocks: Homepage integration (xml), Project integration (e1s)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Component renders all three variants\n- [ ] Avatars link to GitHub profiles\n- [ ] Tooltips show stargazer details\n- [ ] Stats formatted correctly (1.2M, etc.)\n- [ ] Animations respect reduced motion\n- [ ] Mobile responsive\n- [ ] TypeScript types match interfaces from w3q\n- [ ] Works with sample data file\n\n## Reference Components\n\nLook at existing components for patterns:\n- `components/endorsement-showcase.tsx` - Similar social proof display\n- `components/flywheel-visualization.tsx` - Complex interactive component","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:53:39.542004707-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T00:37:49.606434364-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T00:37:49.606434364-05:00","close_reason":"Created NotableStargazers component with homepage, project, and compact variants.

Duplicate Detection\n- [ ] No duplicate project names (exact match)\n- [ ] No near-duplicate names (e.g., \"Ultimate MCP Server\" vs \"MCP Server Ultimate\")\n- [ ] No duplicate GitHub URLs\n- [ ] No projects pointing to same repo with different names\n\n### 2. Content Quality Review\nFor each NEW project added, verify:\n- [ ] Short description is compelling and accurate (not just GitHub desc copy)\n- [ ] Long description adds value beyond short (more detail, use cases)\n- [ ] No marketing fluff or superlatives without substance\n- [ ] Technical accuracy (correct technology claims)\n- [ ] Grammar and spelling correct\n\n### 3. Tag Consistency\n- [ ] All tags use consistent casing (Title Case preferred)\n- [ ] Common tags spelled same everywhere:\n  - \"Rust\" not \"rust\" or \"RUST\"\n  - \"Python\" not \"python\"\n  - \"AI\" not \"ai\" or \"Ai\"\n  - \"DevTools\" not \"Dev Tools\" or \"devtools\"\n  - \"MCP\" not \"mcp\"\n  - \"CLI\" not \"cli\" or \"Cli\"\n- [ ] Each project has 3-5 relevant tags\n- [ ] No overly generic tags like \"code\" or \"programming\"\n\n### 4. Badge Review\n- [ ] Star counts use consistent format:\n  - Under 1000: \"123 stars\"\n  - 1000-9999: \"1.2K stars\" (one decimal)\n  - 10000+: \"10K stars\" (no decimal)\n- [ ] Non-star badges are descriptive (\"Active Research\", \"In development\")\n- [ ] No outdated badges\n\n### 5. Size and Gradient Review\n- [ ] High-star projects (500+) have appropriate size (large/wide)\n- [ ] Gradients used consistently:\n  - Research projects: purple/indigo gradients\n  - Product: emerald/teal gradients\n  - High-impact: distinctive gradients\n- [ ] No ugly gradient combinations\n- [ ] Normal-size projects don't have gradients (generally)\n\n### 6. URL Verification\n- [ ] All GitHub URLs follow format: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/\u003crepo\u003e\n- [ ] Non-GitHub URLs (like pastel.network) are correct\n- [ ] No http:// URLs (all https)\n\n### 7. Ordering Review\n- [ ] High-impact/flagship projects near top of array\n- [ ] Related projects grouped logically (all MCP together, all Flywheel together)\n- [ ] Research projects have kind: \"research\"\n- [ ] Products have kind: \"product\"\n\n### 8. Cross-Reference Check\n- [ ] ntm description matches what we found in pre-flight check\n- [ ] slb description matches what we found in pre-flight check\n- [ ] No content was lost from original entries\n\n## Process\n1. Open lib/content.ts in editor\n2. Go through each new project systematically\n3. Check against existing projects for consistency\n4. Document any issues found\n5.

Current implementation is solid but has:\n- Several bugs affecting data consistency and accessibility\n- Missing interactive features expected in modern UIs\n- Mobile experience that's cramped rather than optimized\n- Lack of micro-interactions and polish that define premium experiences\n\n## Goals\n1. Fix all bugs and accessibility issues (Tier 1)\n2. Add high-impact UX features: search, interactive diagram, copy buttons (Tier 2)\n3. Add premium polish: animations, visual depth, choreography (Tier 3)\n4. Future-proof with advanced features: comparison mode, live data (Tier 4)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Zero accessibility violations (axe-core clean)\n- All touch targets ≥44px\n- Lighthouse performance score ≥90\n- Sub-100ms interaction response times\n- Works flawlessly on mobile and desktop\n- Visitors comment on the polish and smoothness\n\n## Key Files\n- app/tldr/page.tsx - Main page component\n- components/tldr-hero.tsx - Hero section with stats\n- components/tldr-tool-grid.tsx - Tool card grid with sections\n- components/tldr-tool-card.tsx - Individual tool cards\n- components/tldr-synergy-diagram.tsx - SVG synergy visualization\n- lib/content.ts - Tool data (tldrFlywheelTools, tldrPageData)\n\n## Technical Considerations\n- Must respect prefers-reduced-motion throughout\n- Must maintain \u003c100KB JS for initial load\n- All animations via Framer Motion for consistency\n- Mobile-first responsive approach\n- No breaking changes to existing URL structure\n\n## Reference Standards\n- Stripe.com product pages (micro-interactions, depth)\n- Linear.app (keyboard navigation, polish)\n- Vercel.com (dark mode excellence, typography)","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-12T17:49:09.758995199-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-12T17:49:09.758995199-05:00"}

TypeScript Interfaces (Primary Deliverable)\n\nFile: `lib/stargazer-types.ts`\n\nDefine:\n```typescript\ninterface NotableStargazer {\n  login: string;\n  name: string;\n  avatarUrl: string;\n  company?: string;\n  bio?: string;\n  score: number;\n  followers: number;\n  totalStars: number;  // stars on their repos\n  reposStarred: string[];  // which of our repos they starred\n}\n\ninterface StargazerIntelligence {\n  totalUniqueStargazers: number;\n  combinedReach: number;  // sum of all notable stargazers' followers\n  topStargazers: NotableStargazer[];  // top 50-100\n  topCompanies: { name: string; count: number }[];\n  byRepo: Record\u003cstring, { count: number; topStargazers: NotableStargazer[] }\u003e;\n  lastUpdated: string;  // ISO timestamp\n}\n```\n\n### 2.

This is the highest-value integration point—the homepage is where first impressions happen.\n\n## Placement Analysis\n\n### Option C: Flywheel Section Enhancement ⭐ RECOMMENDED\n\n**Add to Flywheel Preview Banner:**\n```\nThe Agentic Coding Tooling Flywheel\n\nSeven interconnected tools that transform how AI coding agents work together...\n\n✨ Used by engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta\n   [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] + 500 more\n```\n\n**Why this is best:**\n- **Contextual**: \"Here are my tools\" → \"Here's who uses them\" (natural flow)\n- **Understated**: Not a whole new section, just enhancement\n- **Efficient**: Leverages existing prominent placement\n- **Follows design principles**: Confident but not boastful\n\n### Option A: Enhance Hero Stats (Secondary)\n\nReplace or enhance existing \"10K+ stars\" stat:\n- Current: \"GitHub Stars: 10K+\"\n- Enhanced: \"Community: 500+ devs with 2M+ reach\"\n\n**Pros:** Immediate visibility, subtle\n**Cons:** Limited space for detail\n\n### Option B: New Section After Endorsements (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n\n**Why avoid:**\n- Creates \"social proof cluster\" (Endorsements + Stargazers back-to-back)\n- Feels like over-emphasis on credibility (insecure)\n- Adds page length without proportional value\n- Redundant with Endorsements section\n\n## Implementation: Option C\n\n### Flywheel Banner Enhancement\n\n```tsx\n{/* In Flywheel Preview Banner */}\n\u003cdiv className=\"mt-6 border-t border-violet-500/20 pt-6\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-4\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"flex -space-x-2\"\u003e\n      {topStargazers.slice(0, 5).map(user =\u003e (\n        \u003cimg \n          key={user.login}\n          src={user.avatarUrl} \n          className=\"h-8 w-8 rounded-full ring-2 ring-slate-900\"\n          alt={user.name}\n        /\u003e\n      ))}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"text-sm\"\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-slate-300\"\u003eUsed by engineers from \u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-violet-400\"\u003eGoogle, Anthropic, Meta\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-slate-500\"\u003e + {totalCount} more\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Data Requirements\n\nMinimal data needed for this approach:\n```typescript\n{\n  topStargazers: NotableStargazer[]  // Top 5 for avatars\n  topCompanies: string[]              // Top 3 company names\n  totalCount: number                  // For \"+ X more\"\n}\n```\n\n## Mobile Behavior\n\n- Avatar strip stays horizontal (wraps if needed)\n- Company names may truncate on very small screens\n- Consider hiding on mobile if it clutters the banner\n\n## Why NOT a Full Section\n\nThe endorsements section already provides social proof from named individuals. Adding another social proof section immediately after would:\n1. Feel redundant\n2. Suggest insecurity (trying too hard to prove value)\n3. Add page length without proportional impact\n\nThe subtle Flywheel banner enhancement achieves the goal without these downsides.\n\n## Alternative: If More Prominence Desired\n\nIf user feedback indicates more visibility is wanted:\n1. First try: Make the banner enhancement more prominent (larger avatars, more companies)\n2. Then try: Add to Hero stats area\n3. Last resort: New section (but reconsider placement)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Component task, Script task (for data)\n- No downstream blockers\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Flywheel banner enhanced with stargazer info\n- [ ] Top 5 avatars displayed\n- [ ] Top 3 company names shown\n- [ ] Total count displayed\n- [ ] Mobile responsive\n- [ ] Consistent with banner styling\n- [ ] No layout shifts during load\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `app/page.tsx` - Enhance Flywheel Preview Banner section\n2.

This script runs locally or via GitHub Action to generate pre-computed JSON data.\n\n## Reference Implementation\n\nLocation: `/tmp/most-influential-github-repo-stars/app/api/github-influencers/route.js`\n\nKey functions to port:\n- `processUser()` - Fetch user details, calculate score\n- `calculateScore()` - The influence scoring algorithm\n- `fetchStargazers()` - Paginated stargazer fetching\n- Caching logic (SQLite-based in original)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Sample Data File (FIRST MILESTONE)\n\n**Create this FIRST to unblock component development (l47) in parallel:**\n\nFile: `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json`\n\nContents: Realistic mock data with:\n- 5-10 fake notable stargazers\n- Plausible scores and companies\n- Proper structure matching TypeScript interfaces\n\nThis allows the component task to proceed in parallel!\n\n### 2. Analysis Script\n\nFile: `scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts` (or .js)\n\nFeatures:\n- Process multiple repos (configurable list)\n- Aggregate unique stargazers across repos\n- Track which repos each user starred\n- Calculate influence scores\n- Aggregate company statistics\n- Output to JSON file\n\n### 3. Configuration\n\nDefine which repos to analyze:\n```typescript\nconst REPOS_TO_ANALYZE = [\n  'Dicklesworthstone/mcp-agent-mail',\n  'Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer',\n  'Dicklesworthstone/cass-memory-system',\n  // ... flywheel repos\n];\n```\n\nOr: analyze ALL public repos for the user.\n\n### 4. Output Format\n\nFile: `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json`\n\nStructure (per design task specifications):\n```json\n{\n  \"totalUniqueStargazers\": 1234,\n  \"combinedReach\": 2500000,\n  \"combinedStars\": 150000,\n  \"topCompanies\": [...],\n  \"topStargazers\": [...],\n  \"byRepo\": {...},\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"2024-12-17T...\"\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Rate Limit Handling\n\nGitHub API limits:\n- 5000 requests/hour with auth\n- Each user requires ~3 requests (profile, repos, events)\n\nStrategies:\n- Process in batches with delays\n- Use conditional requests (If-Modified-Since)\n- Cache user data between runs\n- Skip users below score threshold quickly\n\n### 6. Caching Layer\n\nRecommendation: JSON cache file for simplicity (`.stargazer-cache.json`), can upgrade to SQLite if needed.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Create sample data file first** (enables parallel work)\n2. Set up script scaffolding with TypeScript\n3. Port scoring algorithm\n4. Add multi-repo fetching\n5. Implement deduplication (users who starred multiple repos)\n6. Add company extraction and normalization\n7. Generate output JSON\n8. Add CLI arguments for flexibility\n\n## Technical Notes\n\n### Running Locally\n```bash\n# With bun\nGITHUB_TOKEN=xxx bun run scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts\n\n# Output\nWriting results to lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json\nAnalyzed 30 repos, found 5,432 unique stargazers\nTop stargazer: @influential_dev (score: 125,000)\n```\n\n### Company Normalization\n\nKeep it simple:\n- Strip \"@\" prefix\n- Trim whitespace\n- That's it. Don't over-engineer.\n\n### Score Thresholds\n\n- Only include users with score \u003e 500 in output\n- Keeps JSON size manageable (~50KB target)\n\n### Error Handling\n\n- Individual user fetch failures: log and skip\n- Rate limit: exponential backoff\n- Network errors: retry with delay\n- Missing repos: warn and continue\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Design task (for output format)\n- Blocks: GitHub Action task, Integration tasks\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] **Sample data file created** (milestone 1, unblocks l47)\n- [ ] Script runs successfully on all flywheel repos\n- [ ] Output matches TypeScript interfaces from design task\n- [ ] Rate limiting handled gracefully\n- [ ] Top 50+ notable stargazers identified\n- [ ] Per-repo breakdown included\n- [ ] Script completes in \u003c10 minutes for full analysis\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n- Repo with 0 stargazers\n- Deleted GitHub accounts\n- Private profiles (limited data)\n- Very large repos (10K+ stars) - pagination\n- Users with no public repos (can't calculate their stars)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:52:44.484113852-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T00:47:20.758156328-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T00:47:20.758156328-05:00","close_reason":"Created scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts that analyzes stargazers across 7 repos and generates real data.

{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-azd","title":"Set up GitHub Action for automated stargazer updates","description":"# Task: Set Up GitHub Action for Automated Stargazer Updates\n\n## Context\n\nAutomate the stargazer analysis script to run weekly via GitHub Actions. This ensures the data stays fresh without manual intervention, and commits results directly to the repo for use at build time.\n\n## Why P3?\n\nThis is enhancement work—the feature works without automation (manual script runs). However, automation is important for:\n- Keeping data fresh long-term\n- Reducing maintenance burden\n- Ensuring consistency\n\n## GitHub Token Clarification\n\n**Good news: The default GITHUB_TOKEN should work for your own repos\\!**\n\nThe default `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions has `contents: read` permission for the current repo AND can read public repos. Since we're analyzing Jeffrey's own public repos, this should work without creating a separate PAT.\n\nTry the default token first:\n```yaml\nenv:\n  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nOnly create a PAT if you hit permission issues (unlikely for public repo analysis).\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow\n\nFile: `.github/workflows/update-stargazers.yml`\n\n```yaml\nname: Update Stargazer Intelligence\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Weekly on Sunday at 3 AM UTC\n    - cron: '0 3 * * 0'\n  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger\n\npermissions:\n  contents: write  # Needed for committing changes\n\njobs:\n  analyze:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      \n      - name: Setup Bun\n        uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1\n        \n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: bun install\n        \n      - name: Run stargazer analysis\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Default token should work\\!\n        run: bun run scripts/analyze-stargazers.ts\n        \n      - name: Commit and push if changed\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json\n          git diff --staged --quiet || git commit -m \"chore: update stargazer intelligence data\"\n          git push\n```\n\n### 2. If Default Token Doesn't Work (Fallback)\n\nOnly if you hit issues:\n1. Create PAT at github.com/settings/tokens with `public_repo` scope\n2. Add as repo secret: `STARGAZER_ANALYSIS_TOKEN`\n3. Update workflow to use it\n\n## Schedule Considerations\n\n**Weekly (recommended)**\n- Star data changes slowly\n- Reduces API usage\n- Sufficient for credibility display\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Manually trigger workflow via GitHub UI (`workflow_dispatch`)\n2. Verify script runs successfully\n3. Check commit appears in repo\n4. Verify JSON file is valid\n5.

{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-dxw","title":"Notable Stargazers Intelligence","description":"# Epic: Notable Stargazers Intelligence\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nTransform GitHub presence from vanity metrics (\"10K+ stars\") to meaningful social proof (\"starred by engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta with 2M+ combined reach\"). This feature surfaces WHO starred Jeffrey's repos, not just how many—a powerful credibility signal that most developer portfolios lack.\n\n## Strategic Context\n\n### The Problem with Raw Star Counts\n- Stars are easily inflated (bots, inactive accounts, drive-by clicks)\n- A star from a developer with 100K followers ≠ a star from an empty account\n- Visitors can't assess the QUALITY of engagement from a number alone\n\n### The Solution: Stargazer Intelligence\nLeverage the scoring algorithm from Jeffrey's existing tool (most-influential-github-repo-stars) to:\n1. Analyze all stargazers across flywheel repos\n2. Calculate influence scores based on followers, stars, activity\n3. Surface the most notable individuals and their companies\n4. Display this intelligence throughout the site\n\n### Why This Matters for jeffreyemanuel.com\n- **Credibility**: \"Used by engineers at top AI companies\" \u003e \"10K stars\"\n- **Enterprise signal**: Company affiliations suggest production use\n- **Network proof**: Shows flywheel tools penetrated influential circles\n- **Differentiation**: Sophisticated social proof most portfolios lack\n\n## Technical Approach\n\n### Data Pipeline (Pre-computed, not real-time)\n```\nGitHub API → Analysis Script → JSON file → Build time → Static props\n     ↑                              ↓\n  Weekly via                   Committed to repo\n  GitHub Action                (version controlled)\n```\n\nWhy pre-compute:\n- GitHub API rate limits (5000/hr) make real-time infeasible\n- Star data changes slowly—weekly updates suffice\n- Zero runtime latency\n- Automated via GitHub Action\n\n### Scoring Algorithm (from most-influential-github-repo-stars)\n```javascript\nscore = totalStars * 2.5 + followers * 2.0 + contributions * 0.1 + recentActivity * 0.1\n```\n\nThis weights:\n- Total stars across their repos (proxy for code quality/impact)\n- Follower count (proxy for influence/reach)\n- Contributions (proxy for activity level)\n- Recent activity (proxy for current engagement)\n\n### Data Model\n```typescript\ninterface StargazerIntelligence {\n  totalUniqueStargazers: number;\n  combinedReach: number;           // Sum of followers\n  combinedStars: number;           // Sum of their total stars\n  topCompanies: { name: string; count: number }[];\n  topStargazers: NotableStargazer[];\n  byRepo: Record\u003cstring, RepoStargazerStats\u003e;\n  lastUpdated: string;\n}\n\ninterface NotableStargazer {\n  login: string;\n  name: string;\n  avatarUrl: string;\n  company?: string;\n  followers: number;\n  totalStars: number;\n  score: number;\n  starredRepos: string[];  // Which of Jeffrey's repos they starred\n}\n```\n\n## Display Contexts\n\n| Location | Display | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|---------|\n| Homepage | Aggregate stats + top 5 avatars | Immediate credibility |\n| Project pages | Top 3-5 per-repo stargazers | Per-project proof |\n| (Future) /community | Full ranked list | Deep dive |\n\n## UX Principles\n\nFollowing site design philosophy:\n- **Understated confidence**: Let facts speak, no boasting\n- **Depth on demand**: Summary visible, details for curious\n- **Visual elegance**: Avatar strips, clean typography\n- **Mobile-first**: Responsive layouts\n\n## Relationship to Other Work\n\n**Complements GitHub Heartbeat (2ce)**:\n- Heartbeat = \"The flywheel is actively spinning\" (velocity/activity)\n- Notable Stargazers = \"Look who's using it\" (credibility/quality)\n- Both enhance GitHub presence, different angles\n\n**Independent of Content Enhancement (wh8)**:\n- This has substantial technical component (data pipeline)\n- Warrants own epic for tracking\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. Homepage displays aggregate stargazer intelligence\n2. Project pages show per-repo notable stargazers\n3. Data updates automatically weekly via GitHub Action\n4. Zero runtime API calls (all pre-computed)\n5. Mobile-responsive display\n6. Accessible (proper alt text, ARIA labels)\n\n## Out of Scope (for now)\n\n- Real-time updates\n- Full /community page (can add later)\n- Integration with endorsements section\n- Stargazer notifications/alerts\n\n## Child Tasks\n\n1. Design: Data model, scoring, UX specifications\n2. Script: Multi-repo stargazer analysis\n3. Action: GitHub Action for automation\n4. Component: NotableStargazers display widget\n5.

{"id":"jeffrey_emanuel_personal_site-l47","title":"Create NotableStargazers display component","description":"# Task: Create NotableStargazers Display Component\n\n## Context\n\nBuild a reusable React component that displays stargazer intelligence in various contexts (homepage, project pages). This component is the visual face of the Notable Stargazers feature.\n\n## Parallel Development Note\n\n**This task can start as soon as the sample data file exists\\!**\n\nThe script task (8mq) will create `lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json` as its first milestone. Once that exists, you can develop this component in parallel while the full analysis script is being built.\n\nDuring development:\n```tsx\nimport stargazerData from '@/lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.sample.json';\n// Later: switch to stargazer-intelligence.json when real data exists\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\nFollowing site patterns from existing components:\n- Use Framer Motion for animations with `useReducedMotion`\n- Tailwind CSS for styling (slate/violet color palette)\n- Glass card aesthetic where appropriate\n- Mobile-first responsive design\n- Proper accessibility (ARIA, alt text)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Core Component\n\nFile: `components/notable-stargazers.tsx`\n\n```tsx\ninterface NotableStargazersProps {\n  /** Display mode */\n  variant: 'homepage' | 'project' | 'compact';\n  \n  /** For 'project' variant - which repo to show */\n  repoSlug?: string;\n  \n  /** Maximum stargazers to display */\n  maxItems?: number;\n  \n  /** Show aggregate stats */\n  showStats?: boolean;\n  \n  /** Additional CSS classes */\n  className?: string;\n}\n\nexport function NotableStargazers({ ... }: NotableStargazersProps) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Display Variants\n\n**Homepage Variant (`variant=\"homepage\"`)**\n- Aggregate stats: \"Starred by X developers with Y combined reach\"\n- Avatar strip of top 5-8 stargazers\n- Company mentions: \"Including engineers from Google, Anthropic, Meta\"\n\n**Project Variant (`variant=\"project\"`)**  \n- Per-repo stats: \"X notable developers starred this\"\n- Avatar strip of top 3-5 for that repo\n\n**Compact Variant (`variant=\"compact\"`)**\n- Minimal: Just avatar strip\n- For tight spaces or secondary placements\n\n### 3. Sub-Components\n\n**StargazerAvatar** (inline or separate file)\n- Circular avatar with hover tooltip\n- Links to GitHub profile\n- Fallback for missing images\n\n### 4. Data Loading\n\nImport pre-computed JSON data:\n```tsx\nimport stargazerData from '@/lib/data/stargazer-intelligence.json';\n```\n\nHandle missing/stale data gracefully (hide component if no data).\n\n### 5. Animations\n\nUsing Framer Motion:\n- Staggered avatar appearance\n- Subtle hover scale on avatars\n- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`\n\n### 6. Visual Design\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│  Starred by 500+ developers with 2.1M combined reach        │\n│  Including engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta       │\n│                                                             │\n│  [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤]  + 492 more       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Color Palette\n- Background: slate-900/50 with glass effect\n- Accent: violet-500 for highlights  \n- Avatar borders: subtle ring on hover\n\n### Mobile Behavior\n- Avatar strip scrolls horizontally or wraps\n- Tap to show tooltip (no hover on mobile)\n\n### Error States\n- No data: Hide component entirely\n- Missing avatars: Fallback to initials\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Design task (w3q) for TypeScript interfaces\n- **Can start with sample data** from 8mq milestone 1\n- Blocks: Homepage integration (xml), Project integration (e1s)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Component renders all three variants\n- [ ] Avatars link to GitHub profiles\n- [ ] Tooltips show stargazer details\n- [ ] Stats formatted correctly (1.2M, etc.)\n- [ ] Animations respect reduced motion\n- [ ] Mobile responsive\n- [ ] TypeScript types match interfaces from w3q\n- [ ] Works with sample data file\n\n## Reference Components\n\nLook at existing components for patterns:\n- `components/endorsement-showcase.tsx` - Similar social proof display\n- `components/flywheel-visualization.tsx` - Complex interactive component","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T22:53:39.542004707-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T00:37:49.606434364-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-18T00:37:49.606434364-05:00","close_reason":"Created NotableStargazers component with homepage, project, and compact variants.

This is the highest-value integration point—the homepage is where first impressions happen.\n\n## Placement Analysis\n\n### Option C: Flywheel Section Enhancement ⭐ RECOMMENDED\n\n**Add to Flywheel Preview Banner:**\n```\nThe Agentic Coding Tooling Flywheel\n\nSeven interconnected tools that transform how AI coding agents work together...\n\n✨ Used by engineers from Google, Anthropic, and Meta\n   [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] [👤] + 500 more\n```\n\n**Why this is best:**\n- **Contextual**: \"Here are my tools\" → \"Here's who uses them\" (natural flow)\n- **Understated**: Not a whole new section, just enhancement\n- **Efficient**: Leverages existing prominent placement\n- **Follows design principles**: Confident but not boastful\n\n### Option A: Enhance Hero Stats (Secondary)\n\nReplace or enhance existing \"10K+ stars\" stat:\n- Current: \"GitHub Stars: 10K+\"\n- Enhanced: \"Community: 500+ devs with 2M+ reach\"\n\n**Pros:** Immediate visibility, subtle\n**Cons:** Limited space for detail\n\n### Option B: New Section After Endorsements (NOT RECOMMENDED)\n\n**Why avoid:**\n- Creates \"social proof cluster\" (Endorsements + Stargazers back-to-back)\n- Feels like over-emphasis on credibility (insecure)\n- Adds page length without proportional value\n- Redundant with Endorsements section\n\n## Implementation: Option C\n\n### Flywheel Banner Enhancement\n\n```tsx\n{/* In Flywheel Preview Banner */}\n\u003cdiv className=\"mt-6 border-t border-violet-500/20 pt-6\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv className=\"flex items-center gap-4\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"flex -space-x-2\"\u003e\n      {topStargazers.slice(0, 5).map(user =\u003e (\n        \u003cimg \n          key={user.login}\n          src={user.avatarUrl} \n          className=\"h-8 w-8 rounded-full ring-2 ring-slate-900\"\n          alt={user.name}\n        /\u003e\n      ))}\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv className=\"text-sm\"\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-slate-300\"\u003eUsed by engineers from \u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-violet-400\"\u003eGoogle, Anthropic, Meta\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003cspan className=\"text-slate-500\"\u003e + {totalCount} more\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\n### Data Requirements\n\nMinimal data needed for this approach:\n```typescript\n{\n  topStargazers: NotableStargazer[]  // Top 5 for avatars\n  topCompanies: string[]              // Top 3 company names\n  totalCount: number                  // For \"+ X more\"\n}\n```\n\n## Mobile Behavior\n\n- Avatar strip stays horizontal (wraps if needed)\n- Company names may truncate on very small screens\n- Consider hiding on mobile if it clutters the banner\n\n## Why NOT a Full Section\n\nThe endorsements section already provides social proof from named individuals. Adding another social proof section immediately after would:\n1. Feel redundant\n2. Suggest insecurity (trying too hard to prove value)\n3. Add page length without proportional impact\n\nThe subtle Flywheel banner enhancement achieves the goal without these downsides.\n\n## Alternative: If More Prominence Desired\n\nIf user feedback indicates more visibility is wanted:\n1. First try: Make the banner enhancement more prominent (larger avatars, more companies)\n2. Then try: Add to Hero stats area\n3. Last resort: New section (but reconsider placement)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: Component task, Script task (for data)\n- No downstream blockers\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Flywheel banner enhanced with stargazer info\n- [ ] Top 5 avatars displayed\n- [ ] Top 3 company names shown\n- [ ] Total count displayed\n- [ ] Mobile responsive\n- [ ] Consistent with banner styling\n- [ ] No layout shifts during load\n\n## Files to Modify\n\n1. `app/page.tsx` - Enhance Flywheel Preview Banner section\n2.

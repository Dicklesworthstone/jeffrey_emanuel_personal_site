# Google Analytics
# ================================================================================
# Your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
#
# HOW TO GET THIS:
# 1. Go to https://analytics.google.com/
# 2. Create a new GA4 property or use an existing one
# 3. Go to Admin > Data Streams > Web
# 4. Click your web stream
# 5. Copy the "Measurement ID" (starts with G-)
#
# NOTE: This is NOT a secret! GA tracking IDs are meant to be public and visible
# in client-side code. We use an env var for flexibility, not security.
#
# DOMAIN SETUP:
# - You can set this up NOW even before your domain transfer completes
# - GA will track whatever domain your site runs on (localhost, vercel.app, jeffreyemanuel.com)
# - Once jeffreyemanuel.com points to your site, GA will automatically show that domain
# - No need to wait for DNS to propagate
#
# DEPLOYMENT:
# - On Vercel: Add this in Project Settings > Environment Variables
# - Locally: Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your GA ID
#
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=

# Example (replace with your actual ID):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-ABC123XYZ
